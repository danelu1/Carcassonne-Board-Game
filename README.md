# Carcassonne-Board-Game
My third project in Programming Paradigms course. An implementation of the "Carcassonne" board game in Prolog, using built-in predicates and logic programming.
The project consists of operations that can be made on a tile in the game, like rotating it and representing it like a list containing citadels, paths and fields on its 4 directions, and also a representation for the board, with operations like placing a tile and checking if the move you are doing is valid or not. Only 16 pieces from the original game are used.
